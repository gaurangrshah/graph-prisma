# Prisma

---------------------------------

Prisma is similar to an ORM, and is used to model data in a database.

## Setup Prisma Dependencies / Tools

---------------------------------

First step is to setup a database, we'll be using `PostGres` which pairs very well with GraphQL. We'll be using the free-tier PostGres database available from Heroku: https://dashboard.heroku.com, Once we're signed up we can login and create an application, give it a meaningful name and then click on the `Resources` tab:

> From the settings tab we'll need our credentials for our postgres database, and that is all we need from heroku.



Next we can install a tool called `PGAdmin` - which allows us to manage our postGres database via a GUI.

Download & Install: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ â€” 

Next we can setup the connection to our database in PGAdmin to connect it to our server that we just setup. Once installed PGAdmin can be launched and should open in our browser:

Next we can configure our new server by clicking `Add New Server`:

Once we add the server only one of the databases listed on this shared server is ours to access - we can find it by name:

Once we have our database showing up in PGAdmin, we can go ahead and intall our next tool: `Docker`:

Had to install docker toolbox to get docker working, seems the newer machines have a different setup:

## Prisma Setup

---------------------------------

We'll start by installing prisma into our project:

```shell
yarn add prisma@1.12.0
```

test install:

```shell
prisma -v
```

initialize a new project: `/graph-prisma`

```shell
prisma init
```

Prisma has automatically generated 3 core files we'll need in order to integrate our database with prisma:

1. `datamodel.prisma` - defines any typeDefs that we want prisma to be aware of â€” similar to schema.graphql

   ```js
   type User {
     id: ID! @id
     name: String!
   }
   ```

2. `prisma.yml` - a configuration file for our prisma server: 

   ```js
   endpoint: http://localhost:4466
   datamodel: datamodel.prisma
   ```

3. `docker-compose-yml` - this is our bootstrap file for the docker container that contains all our server and database configurations:

   ```js
   version: '3'
   services:
     prisma:
       image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.34
       restart: always
       ports:
       - "4466:4466"
       environment:
         PRISMA_CONFIG: |
           port: 4466
           # uncomment the next line and provide the env var PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=my-secret to activate cluster security
           # managementApiSecret: my-secret
           databases:
             default:
               connector: postgres
               host: ec2-54-235-92-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com
               database: dfihfv93clsme0
               schema: public
               user: fdniohmukbfwdl
               password: 07c96292a944b2766b34f0574f0fe14e4b3b67222d55e6975275aafa6e7a6c58
               ssl: true /*  must always be specified  */
               rawAccess: true
               port: '5432'
               migrations: true
   ```



We'll need to make a single changes to this file before we deploy by just removing this line:

```js
# schema: public
```



Now we can use docker to compose our server with the settings we've specified above by running:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```



Next we can deploy our latest changes to our prisma server:

```shell
yarn prisma deploy
```



Add deploy script to package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "prisma deploy"
}
```

Now we can run deploy via yarn: 

```shell
yarn deploy
```

> Result:
>
> ```shell
> Changes:
> 
>   User (Type)
>   + Created type `User`
>   + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
>   + Created field `name` of type `String!`
> ```
>
> ðŸš§ might be an issue but course files generated an updatedAt and createAt field as well.
>
> We can also see in the output that we have a new graphQL playground instace to query our prisma bindings:

## Configure and setup existing prisma db:

after downloading the starter files, you can run:

```shell
yarn
```

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

might need to reconfigure your prisma endpoint in `prisma.yml` to match the local ip of the docker instance:

```js
# endpoint: http://localhost:4466
endpoint: http://192.168.99.100:4466
datamodel: datamodel.prisma

```

Test the endpoint by navigating to it

then run

```shell
prisma deploy
```

and you should have a working graphQL playground instance. running at the above endpoint. Once we've depolyed the prisma database our docker graphQL instance will have access to that db
