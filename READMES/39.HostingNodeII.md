# Hosting Node Application (Part 2)

---------------------------------

> Node.js support for Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support
>
> ### [Heroku-specific build steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#heroku-specific-build-steps)
>
> While Node.js has standard `preinstall` and `postinstall` scripts, sometimes you may want to run scripts only before or after builds on Heroku. For instance, you may need to configure npm, git, or ssh before Heroku installs dependencies. Or, you may need to build production assets after dependencies are installed.
>
> For Heroku-specific actions, use the `heroku-prebuild` and `heroku-postbuild` scripts:
>
> ```json
> "scripts": {
>   "heroku-prebuild": "echo This runs before Heroku installs your dependencies.",
>   "heroku-postbuild": "echo This runs afterwards."
> }
> ```



Implement heroku buid steps configuration:

`package.json`:

```json
"heroku-postbuild": "babel src --out-dir dist",
```

> run `babel` command on all files in the `src` directory then we provide the `--out-dir` (output directory):  `dist` 

```shell
âžœ npm run heroku-postbuild

> graph-basics@1.0.0 heroku-postbuild /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-prisma
> babel src --out-dir dist

src/db.js -> dist/db.js
src/index.js -> dist/index.js
src/prisma.js -> dist/prisma.js
src/resolvers/Comment.js -> dist/resolvers/Comment.js
src/resolvers/Mutation.js -> dist/resolvers/Mutation.js
src/resolvers/Post.js -> dist/resolvers/Post.js
src/resolvers/Query.js -> dist/resolvers/Query.js
src/resolvers/Subscription.js -> dist/resolvers/Subscription.js
src/resolvers/User.js -> dist/resolvers/User.js
src/resolvers/index.js -> dist/resolvers/index.js
src/utils/generateToken.js -> dist/utils/generateToken.js
src/utils/getUserId.js -> dist/utils/getUserId.js
src/utils/hashPassword.js -> dist/utils/hashPassword.js
```

The `dist/` directory is the directory we're going to want heroku to run our babel transpiled application from, but we'll notice that some files are missing that aren't `.js` related, and therefore do not get processed by babel, to fix this issue we can add a flag onto our script command:

```js
"heroku-postbuild": "babel src --out-dir dist --copy-files"
```

> by copying all files we're ensuring that our and `schema.graphql` & `prisma.graphql` files get added to our `dist/`  as well.

Once this process is complete we now have everything in place that node needs to run our application, so we can setup our production start script:

```json
"start": "env-cmd ./config/prod.env node dist/index.js",
```

> this will serve up our applicaiton from the `dist/` that gets created after babel transpiles all the files in the `src/` 



> **Babel Runtime PolyFill for Production**
>
> ```shell
> /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-prisma/dist/resolvers/Query.js:100
>     var _ref6 = _asyncToGenerator( /*#__PURE__*/regeneratorRuntime.mark(function _callee(parent, args, _ref5, info) {
>                                                 ^
> 
> ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined
> ```
>
> Currently we may see an error about requiring a regenerator at runtime, we can implement a fix for this in the form of a polyfill from babel: https://new.babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill
>
> 
>
> ```shell
> npm install babel-polyfill@7.0.0
> ```
>
> > as per the docs: This polyfill is automatically loaded when using `babel-node`. , which is why we got it out of the box with our local env, whereas it needs to be implemented otherwise for our production env. 
>
> Once installed we need to incorporate the polyfill into our project: `index.js`:
>
> ```js
> import "babel-polyfill";
> ```
>
> Then run:
>
> ```shell
> npm run heroku-postbuild
> ```
