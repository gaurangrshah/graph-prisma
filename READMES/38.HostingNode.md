# Hosting Node App in Production:

---------------------------------

Our goal here is to have our Node.js application deployed via heroku. We'll be using two tools to get this done:

- `git` - used to track code changes and push them up to heroku, allowing heroku to deploy our updated application.
- [`heroku cli`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) - allows us to run heroku commands to manage our applications.

```shell
npm install -g heroku
```

```shell
heroku login
```

Now we can configure our application with our Heroku account:

`src/index.js` (current state)

> ```js
> server.start({ port: 4001 }, () => {
>   console.log('served up: http://localhost:4001')
> });
> ```
>
> By default our server is set to start on `port: 4000`, we'll need to configure our server to use the port that heroku assigns for our application. Heroku injects an environment variable and we can use that variable to make sure we're binding to the correct port. We use [graphql yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) for this purpose.

> #### `start(options: Options, callback: ((options: Options) => void) = (() => null)): Promise<void>`
>
> Once your `GraphQLServer` is instantiated, you can call the `start` method on it. It takes two arguments: `options`, the options object defined above, and `callback`, a function that's invoked right before the server is started. As an example, the `callback` can be used to print information that the server has started.
>
> The `options` object has the following fields:
>
> | Key                      | Type                                                         | Default                                                      | Note                                                         |

`index.js`:

```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 4001

server.start({ port }, () => {
  // process.env.PORT = heroku assigned port for production
  // 4001 = default local port for development
  console.log(`served up: http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```

> the value for `process.env.PORT` will only exist when we run our production start script, otherwise, it will default to our local port. 

Currently our start script is using nodemon to watch our server for us, and update when changes occur, although this is only used in development, so we'll need to handle the server's start script for production as well to do this we're using a small library called `env-cmd`:

```
npm i env-cmd@8.0.2
```

First lets create a separate command for our dev start script, and test that we can get the dev script working as it was with the new settings using our env variables via `env-cmd`

`package.json`:

```js
  "scripts": {
    "start": "",
    "dev": "env-cmd ./config/dev.env nodemon src/index.js --ext js,graphql --exec babel-node",
    "get-schema": "graphql get-schema -p prisma",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```



`prisma.js`:

```js
export const prisma = new Prisma({
  typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
  endpoint: process.env.PRISMA_ENDPOINT,
  secret: 'thisismysupersecrettext',
  fragmentReplacements, // exposes all extracted fragments from resolvers.
});
```



Now we can run our dev environment and make sure that our local host runs, since `process.env.PORT` won't get assigned as we're only running the dev script, it will default to our default `port`: `@4001`

```js
âžœ npm run dev

> graph-basics@1.0.0 dev /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-prisma
> env-cmd ./config/dev.env nodemon src/index.js --ext js,graphql --exec babel-node

[nodemon] 1.19.1
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `babel-node src/index.js`
served up: http://localhost:4001
```



Now that our local server is back to working state, we can go ahead and handle the start script for our production environment
