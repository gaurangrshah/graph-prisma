# Prisma Config

---------------------------------

Once we have our server up and running and our database running as well, our server is just waiting for something to be deployed to it. All this requires is a datamodel, so we just need to deploy our datamodel to the new heroku/prisma server we have created. To do this we'll need to create a dynamic endpoint for deployment, to do this we'll need to modify our docker settings:

> The best solution is to create 2 configuration files: 
>
> - production config
> - development config
>
> each with their own endpoints that we can set from environment variables. 

 `docker-compose.yml` (current state)

```js
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.34
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        # uncomment the next line and provide the env var PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=my-secret to activate cluster security
        # managementApiSecret: my-secret
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: ec2-54-235-246-201.compute-1.amazonaws.com
            port: '5432'
            database: dbadq3c1ttjc01
            password: xdxxxxdxxxdxx

            ssl: true
            user: hlkfvgvivxdpjw
            migrations: true
            rawAccess: true
```



---------------------------------

Create 2 new files in a new `config/`:

- `dev.env`
- `prod.env`

We'll extract our current development endpoint and setup environment variables for the development server since we can test that already:

`dev.env`:

```js
PRISMA_ENDPOINT=http://192.168.99.100:4466
```

Test from `graph-prisma/prisma`:

```shell
➜ prisma deploy -e /config/dev.env 

Deploying service `default` to stage `default` to server `default` 4.3s
Service is already up to date.

   ╭──────────────────────────────────────╮
   │                                      │
   │   Update available 1.34.0 → 1.34.1   │
   │    Run npm i -g prisma to update     │
   │                                      │
   ╰──────────────────────────────────────╯
```

> we are able to manually deploy providing the values we want used, in this case our development endpoint

Instead of using a variable like we do in our `dev.env` file, for the production server we can let prisma define the endpoint for us in order to do that, we'll need to login to prisma using their cli tool"

```shell
graph-prisma/prisma on  master [!?] via ⬢ v10.

➜ prisma login

   ╰──────────────────────────────────────╯

```

Now that we're authenticated with prisma, we now have access to that database and server, and can tell prisma to deploy from our `prod.env` settings even though it's empty, this will force prisma to populate the settings required for us — allowing us to setup the configuration for the production envornment:

```shell
➜ prisma deploy -e /config/prod.env 
 ▸    [WARNING] in
 ▸    /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-prisma/prisma/prisma.yml:
 ▸    A valid environment variable to
 ▸    satisfy the declaration
 ▸    'env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT' could not be found.

 ▸    [WARNING] in
 ▸    /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-prisma/prisma/prisma.yml:
 ▸    A valid environment variable to
 ▸    satisfy the declaration
 ▸    'env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT' could not be found.

? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an ex
isting server? graph-prisma-dev/prisma-dev
? Choose a name for your service prisma-dev-ser
ve
? Choose a name for your stage prod

Written endpoint `https://prisma-dev-91564115af
.herokuapp.com/prisma-dev-serve/prod` to prisma
.yml
```

> We can see that prisma had us select the server available from our heroku account, then named the service for that server, and chose a stage, in our case: production. 
>
> And lastly it has generated an endpoint for us, and actually written it to our `prisma.yml` settings:
>
> ```js
> #endpoint: http://localhost:4466
> #endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
> endpoint: https://prisma-dev-91564115af.herokuapp.com/prisma-dev-serve/prod
> datamodel: datamodel.prisma
> secret: thisismysupersecrettext
> 
> ```

Use the new prisma production endpoint to seup the production variable `prod.env` :

```js
PRISMA_ENDPOINT=https://prisma-dev-91564115af.herokuapp.com/prisma-dev-serve/prod
```

And update `prisma.yml` to reflect new changes and access the endpoint via the env variables:

```js

#endpoint: http://localhost:4466
endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
secret: thisismysupersecrettext
```

```shell
graph-prisma/prisma on  master [!?] via ⬢ v10.15.3 
➜ prisma deploy -e /config/prod.env 
Deploying service `prisma-dev-serve` to stage `
prod` to server `prisma-dev` 1.8s
Service is already up to date.
```



With this in place our settings now allow us to interact with all of our instances, based on which environment we need to maintain.  Also this has now gaenerated our new prisma service that we configured via the cli tool:



<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; border: 1px solid grey;">

Tests: `createUser` in production:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; border: 1px solid grey;">
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
	    <pre><code>```
	    mutation {

    data: {
      name: "greg",
      email: "gaurang.r.shah@gmail.com",
      password: "abc12345",
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
	    ```</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
	    <pre><code>```
	    {
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "id": "cjy3p62on001g0705wpoqqt3o",
      "name": "greg",
      "email": "gaurang.r.shah@gmail.com"
    }
  }
}
	    ```</code></pre>
    </div>

**NOTE**: we not have our schema available in `pgAdmin` :

> **NOTE**: password is not being hashed, this indicates that we have not yet hooked up our node application that handles that logic for us. 

We can also verify these changes in our prisma database as well:
