# Add New Type

---------------------------------

Adding a new type starts by defining the type in our `datamodel.prisma` - in this case we'll 

```js
type Post {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  title: String!
  body: String!
  published: Boolean!
  author: User! # references the User type
}
```

> published is a non-nullable `Boolean` - must be either true or false
>
> author - is a field that gets associated with the `User` who creates the post, so author will always return a `User!`
>
> This relationship must go both ways:
>
> ```js
> type User {
>   id: ID! @id @unique
>   name: String!
>   email: String! @unique
>   posts: [Post!]!
> }
> ```
>
> we've made sure that the `User` type also knows that it can have posts associated with it, in this case, it is an array of `Post!` items.

Then we can re-deploy our schema:

```js
prisma deploy
```

> which will result in a bunch of changes to the database:

> Changes:
> 
>   Post (Type)
>   + Created type `Post`
>   + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
>   + Created field `title` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `body` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `published` of type `Boolean!`
>   + Created field `author` of type `User!`
> 
>   User (Type)
>   + Created field `posts` of type `[Post!]!`
> 
>   PostToUser (Relation)
>   + Created an inline relation between `Post` and `User` in the column `author` of table `Post`
> ```



Let's test this out by creating a new post for our user:

```js
mutation createPost {
  createPost(data: {
  	title: "prisma post"
    body: ""
    published: true
    author: {
      connect: {
        id: "cjxj80fao000w0761v5foydjk"
      }
    }
  }){
    id
    title
    published
    author{
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

> We simply need an unique identifier for that user (`name` or  `email`) in order to create a post associated with them, prisma provides a utitlity to do just that called `connect: UserWhereUniqueInput`, and what connect does is to connect (or associate) one piece of data with another. In our cases we want to connect our post to a user.

> As we can see we've not connected a new post to our existing user.

> **NOTE**: keep in mind that we can also create a new user to associate with our post when creating a post instead of connecting it to an existing user.





- Add `Comments` type Definition: `datamodel.prisma`:

  ```js
  type Comment {
      id: ID!
      text: String!
      author: User!
      post: Post!
  }
  ```

- re-deploy to prisma

  ```js
  Changes:
  
    Comment (Type)
    + Created type `Comment`
    + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
    + Created field `text` of type `String!`
    + Created field `author` of type `User!`
    + Created field `post` of type `Post!`
  
    CommentToUser (Relation)
    + Created an inline relation between `Comment` and `User` in the column `author` of table `Comment`
  
    CommentToPost (Relation)
    + Created an inline relation between `Comment` and `Post` in the column `post` of table `Comment`

- Complete the following tasks in `GQL`:

  > - update the current post to be published:
  >
  >   ```js
  >   mutation updatePost {
  >     updatePost(
  >       where: {id: "cjxj9ts6u002j0761e56cm260"}, 
  >       data: {published: true}
  >     ) {
  >       id
  >       title
  >       published
  >     }
  >   }
  >   ```
  >
